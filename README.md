# PageRank
PageRank and HITS algorithms via Julia

Final project for 21241 Matrices and Linear Transformations, Fall 22

Includes, given a list representation of a node graph:
- algorithm for computing adjacency matrices
- algorithm for deriving a transition probability matrix
- algorithm for computing PageRank for a given internet/node space
- algorithm for computing HITS for a given internet/node space
- final paper detailing the process of writing and arriving at these algorithms

To run, install the Julia extension on VS Code or other editors
